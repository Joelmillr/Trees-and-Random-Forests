Simulation is an incredibly useful tool in data science. We can use simulation to evaluate how algorithms perform against ground truth, and how algorithms compare to one another.
In this assignment, you will be implementing and extending the nested spheres simulation study found in Elements of Statistical Learning page 339. https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/
